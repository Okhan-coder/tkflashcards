# About

This is a script that converts markdown notes into a flashcards game.
Run via `python game.py /path/to/notes.md`.


Input notes must contain lines in a certain format to be turned into flashcards, here is an [all text example](https://gist.github.com/ilyakava/b595008ac0bdece952376f20660699d8) and a [text and latex example](https://gist.github.com/ilyakava/0af06d0bc55ea3da9893).
